    <string name="place_description_sidi_saiyyed_mosque">The Sidi Saiyyed Mosque, popularly known as Sidi Saiyyid ni Jali locally, built in 1572\-73 AD (Hijri year 980), is one of the most famous mosques of Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India. As attested by the marble tablet fixed on the wall of the mosque, it was built by Sidi Saiyyid in the retinue of Bilal Jhajar Khan, general in the army of the last Sultan Shams\-ud\-Din Muzaffar Shah III of the Gujarat Sultanate.\n\nThe mosque was built in the last year of the existence of Gujarat Sultanate. The mosque is entirely arcuated and is famous for beautifully carved ten stone latticework windows (jalis) on the side and rear arches.\n\nThe rear wall is filled with square stone pierced panels in geometrical designs. The two bays flanking the central aisle have reticulated stone slabs carved in designs of intertwined trees and foliage and a palm motif. This intricately carved lattice stone window is the Sidi Saiyyed Jali, the unofficial symbol of city of Ahmedabad and the inspiration for the design of the logo of the Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad.</string>
